# StockAnalyzerApi
This API is used for gathering stock data and returning analyses on different asset types and how they can be compared.

This is a Python project, and we'll be using Anaconda to manage our packages and virtual environments.

To run this project, the virtual environment must be activated. All dependencies and modules will be installed using the virtual environment (which will be named StockAnalyzerApi).
